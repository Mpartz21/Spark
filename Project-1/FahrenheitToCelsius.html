        <h3>Formula: (32°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C</h3>
        <h4>History of Fahrenheit & Celsius</h4>
        <p>The Celsius scale is named after Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius,<br>
           who developed it in 1742.<br>
           Celsius measured the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level<br>
           and divided the distance between the two into hundredths.<br>
           He originally had the scale in the opposite order of the scale used today<br>
           — 0°C was the boiling point of water, and 100°C was the freezing point<br>
           — but other scientists later reversed the scale.</p>
        <p>The Fahrenheit scale was first proposed in 1724 by the German physicist<br>
           Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. Using a tube filled with mercury or alcohol, <br>
           Fahrenheit determined his scale based on three points.<br>
           He set the point at which water, ice, and ammonium chloride (a salt) stabilized as 0°F.<br>
           He set the point at which still water just began to form ice on its surface as 32°F.<br>
           He set the temperature of the human body taken in the mouth or under the arm as 96°F.<br>
