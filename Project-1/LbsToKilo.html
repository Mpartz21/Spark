        <h4>History of Pounds & Kilograms</h4>
        <p>
            The pound is descended from the Roman libra (hence the abbreviation "lb").<br>
            The English word pound is cognate with, among others, German Pfund, Dutch pond,<br>
            and Swedish pund. These units are historic and are no longer used formally,<br>
            though informal use to mean 500 grams may be heard.<br>
        </p>    
        <p>
            The kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one litre of water.<br>
            This definition was simple yet difficult to use in practice. However, <br>
            even modern, superseding definitions of a kilogram are accurate to <br>
            within 30 ppm of the mass of one litre of water. In 1799, the platinum <br>
            Kilogramme des Archives replaced it as the standard of mass. In 1889, <br>
            a cylinder of platinum-iridium, the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK)<br>
            became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system, and remained so until 2019.<br>
            The kilogram was the last of the SI units to be defined by a physical artefact.
