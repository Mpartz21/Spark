        <h4>History of Kilometers & Miles</h4>
        <p>
            By a decree of 8 May 1790, the Constituent assembly ordered the <BR>
            French Academy of Sciences to develop a new measurement system. <BR>
            In August 1793, the French National Convention decreed the metre as <BR>
            the sole length measurement system in the French Republic. <br>
            The first name of the kilometre was "Millaire". Although the metre was formally <br>
            defined in 1799, the myriametre (10000 metres) was preferred to the "kilometre" <br>
            for everyday use. The term "myriamètre" appeared a number of times <br>
            in the text of Develey's book Physique d'Emile: ou, Principes <br>
            de la science de la nature, (published in 1802), while the term kilometre <br>
            only appeared in an appendix. French maps published in 1835 had scales <br>
            showing myriametres and "lieues de Poste" (Postal leagues of about 4288 metres).<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Roman mile (mille passus, lit. "thousand paces"; abbr. m.p.; also milia <br>
            and mille) consisted of a thousand paces as measured by every other step—as <br>
            in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times. <br>
            The ancient Romans, marching their armies through uncharted territory, <br>
            would often push a carved stick in the ground after each 1,000 paces. <br>
            Well-fed and harshly driven Roman legionaries in good weather <br>
            thus created longer miles. The distance was indirectly standardised by <br>
            Agrippa's establishment of a standard Roman foot (Agrippa's own) in 29 BC, <br>
            and the definition of a pace as 5 feet. An Imperial Roman mile thus denoted <br>
            5,000 Roman feet. Surveyors and specialised equipment such as the decempeda <br>
            and dioptra then spread its use.<br>
