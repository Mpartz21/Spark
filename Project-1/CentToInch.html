        <h3>Formula: divide the length of the centimeter value by 2.54</h3>
        <h4>History of Centimeter & Inch</h4>
        <p>
            The first practical realisation of the metric system came in 1799, <br>
            during the French Revolution, after the existing system of measures had <br>
            become impractical for trade, and was replaced by a decimal system based on <br>
            the kilogram and the metre. The basic units were taken from the natural world. <br>
            The unit of length, the metre, was based on the dimensions of the Earth, <br>
            and the unit of mass, the kilogram, was based on the mass of a volume of water of one litre (a cubic decimetre). <br>
            Reference copies for both units were manufactured in platinum and remained the standards of measure for the next 90 years. <br>
            After a period of reversion to the mesures usuelles due to unpopularity of the metric system,<br>
            the metrication of France and much of Europe was complete by the 1850s.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The earliest known reference to the inch in England is from the Laws of Ã†thelberht <br>
            dating to the early 7th century, surviving in a single manuscript, the Textus Roffensis from 1120. <br>
            Paragraph LXVII sets out the fine for wounds of various depths: one inch, one shilling; two inches, two shillings, etc.<br>
