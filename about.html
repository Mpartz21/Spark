                Hello my name is Miguel Partida. I am from San Diego, California. <br>
                I am 23 years old and I am the oldest of 6 siblings. I am still<br>
                working at Panda Express as a cook. My favorite thing about working<br>
                there is no matter how busy it gets I still get to cook in the big wok,<br>
                which I find to be really fun. I have been coding for about two years now <br>
                and I think I finally have a clue about what I am doing now. I am really <br>
                to be participating in this training and cannot wait to learn more.
